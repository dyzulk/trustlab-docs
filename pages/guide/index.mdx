# TrustLab Documentation

Welcome to the **TrustLab User Guide**.
TrustLab is a private Certificate Authority (CA) designed to secure your internal infrastructure (Intranet, APIs, IoT, Databases) with SSL/TLS certificates.

## Quick Start

  <Card icon={<ShieldCheck />} title="Core Concepts (PKI)" href="/guide/concepts" arrow />
</Cards>

## Guide Structure

This documentation is organized as follows:

*   [**Getting Started**](/guide/getting-started/install-root-ca): Setup Root CA and access the dashboard.
*   [**Core Concepts**](/guide/concepts): Understand the "Two Lanes of Trust" (Public vs Private PKI).
*   [**Certificate Operations**](/guide/certificates/request-new): Request, Download, Renew, and Revoke certificates.
*   [**Integrations**](/guide/integrations/web-servers): Configure Nginx, IIS, and S/MIME.
*   [**Troubleshooting**](/guide/troubleshooting/browser-errors): Resolve common browser errors like `NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID`.

## Why TrustLab?

TrustLab solves the "Not Secure" warnings on internal networks by providing a centralized, managed PKI that acts just like a Public CA (Let's Encrypt), but for your **Private Network**.
