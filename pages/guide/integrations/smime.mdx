# S/MIME Email Security

Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) allows you to **sign** and **encrypt** internal emails.

- **Signing**: Proves the email actually came from you (prevents spoofing).
- **Encryption**: Ensures only the intended recipient can read the message.

## Prerequisites
- A TrustLab certificate with the **S/MIME** profile.
- Downloaded in **PFX (.p12)** format.

## Outlook (Windows) Setup
1. Open Outlook. Go to **File > Options > Trust Center**.
2. Click **Trust Center Settings > Email Security**.
3. Under "Encrypted Email", click **Settings**.
4. Click **Choose** for Signing Certificate and select your TrustLab ID.
5. Click **OK**.

## Thunderbird Setup
1. Go to **Settings > Privacy & Security**.
2. Scroll to **Certificates** and click **Manage Certificates**.
3. Under **"Your Certificates"**, click **Import**.
4. Select your `.p12` file.
5. Go back to Account Settings > Security.
6. Select the certificate for **Digital Signing** and **Encryption**.

> [!TIP]
> To send encrypted email to a colleague, you must first possess their Public Key (usually by receiving a signed email from them first).
