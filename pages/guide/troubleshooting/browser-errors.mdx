# Common Browser Errors

When using internal certificates, browsers are very strict. Below are the most common error codes and how to resolve them.

### `NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID`

<Callout type="error" emoji={<AlertTriangle className="w-5 h-5" />}>
  **The Logic:** The browser simply **does not know** the "TrustLab Root CA" that signed your website's certificate, so it assumes it's fake.
</Callout>

**Solution:**
You have not installed the Root CA on your device yet.
*   [**Install Root CA Guide**](/guide/getting-started/install-root-ca)

### `NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID`

<Callout type="warning" emoji={<Globe className="w-5 h-5" />}>
  **The Logic:** You are visiting `app.local`, but the certificate was only issued for `api.local`. The names **do not match**.
</Callout>

**Solution:**
The domain is missing from the certificate's **SANs (Subject Alternative Names)**.
1.  Click the **"Not Secure"** icon > **Certificate**.
2.  Check the **DNS Name** or SAN field.
3.  If missing, you must **[Generate a New Certificate](/guide/certificates/request-new)** that includes the correct domain.

### `NET::ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID`

<Callout type="info" emoji={<Calendar className="w-5 h-5" />}>
  **The Logic:** The certificate has expired, OR your computer's clock is set to the wrong date (past/future).
</Callout>

**Solution:**
1.  Check your system clock first.
2.  If the clock is correct, the certificate is truly expired.
3.  **[Renew the Certificate](/guide/certificates/renewal)** immediately.
