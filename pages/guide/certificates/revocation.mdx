# Revocation (Cabut Sertifikat)

Revocation invalidates a certificate before its expiration date. This is critical if a Private Key is compromised.

## When to Revoke?
- **Key Compromise**: You suspect someone stole your Private Key.
- **Service Change**: The domain name effectively no longer belongs to the service.
- **Mistake**: The certificate was issued with incorrect details.

## How to Revoke

1. Open the Certificate Detail page.
2. Click the **"Revoke"** button (Danger Zone).
3. Select a **Reason Code**:
   - `unspecified` (0)
   - `keyCompromise` (1)
   - `cACompromise` (2)
   - `superseded` (4)
   - `cessationOfOperation` (5)
4. Confirm the action.

## CRL (Certificate Revocation List)
Once revoked, the certificate serial number is added to the TrustLab CRL. All clients checking the CRL will immediately reject the certificate.
