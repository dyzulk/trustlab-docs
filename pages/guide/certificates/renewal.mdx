# Renewal Process

Certificates expire to ensure security rotation. TrustLab simplifies the renewal process so you don't experience downtime.

## When to Renew
You will receive an email notification:
- **30 days** before expiration.
- **7 days** before expiration.
- **1 day** before expiration.

## How to Renew

1. Log in to TrustLab.
2. Navigate to **"My Certificates"**.
3. Identify certificates marked with the **"Expiring Soon"** badge.
4. Click the **"Renew"** button next to the certificate.
5. Review the details (CN, SANs). You can add or remove SANs at this stage.
6. Click **Confirm Renewal**.

## What Happens Next?
- A **new certificate** is generated with a new validity period.
- The **Private Key** remains the same (if "Reuse Key" was selected) OR a new key is generated (recommended).
- The old certificate remains valid until its original expiration date (unless revoked).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must **download and install the new certificate** on your server. Renewal **does not** happen automatically on the server side unless you use our ACME integration.
