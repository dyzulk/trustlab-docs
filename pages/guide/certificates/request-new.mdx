# Requesting a New Certificate

TrustLab provides a streamlined wizard to generate private SSL/TLS certificates for your internal infrastructure.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
*   Active TrustLab account access.
*   **Root CA** installed on your machine (to trust the generated certs).

---

<Steps>
### 1. Open Certificates Menu
Navigate to the **Certificates** page. This view lists all your active and expired certificates. Click the **"Generate New"** (or "+") button to start.

### 2. Enter Domain Details (Default Mode)
By default, you only need to provide the Identity. The system will auto-fill the Organization & Location metadata.

*   **Common Name (CN)**: The primary domain (e.g., `app.internal`).
*   **SANs**: Additional domains or IP addresses.
*   **Key Strength**: Choose the encryption level.

    *   **2048-bit**: Industry standard, compatible with all devices.
    *   **4096-bit**: Higher security, slightly more CPU intensive.

### 3. Customize CSR (Manual Control)
Toggle **"Manual Control"** if you need to override the default Identity fields (e.g., for a specific branch office or legal entity).

*   **Organization (O)**: Override the default company name.
*   **Locality (L) / State (ST)**: Set specific location data.
*   **Country (C)**: ISO Code.


### 4. Submit & Download
Click **Generate**.
*   **Private Key**: The system will prompt you to download the `.key` file. **This is the only time it is available.**
*   **Certificate**: The `.pem` / `.crt` file will be available for download immediately.
</Steps>

  **Security:** Your **Private Key** is shown/downloaded **ONLY ONCE**. Store it securely immediately. If lost, you must revoke and reissue the certificate.
