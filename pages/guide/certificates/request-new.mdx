# Requesting a New Certificate

TrustLab allows you to request private SSL/TLS certificates for various internal uses.

## Prerequisites
- You must have an active TrustLab account.
- You must have the **Root CA** installed on your machine.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Log in to Dashboard**
   Navigate to the TrustLab Dashboard and login with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to "New Certificate"**
   Click on the **"New Request"** button in the top navigation bar or the main dashboard card.

3. **Select Certificate Profile**
   Choose the profile that matches your need:
   - **Internal Web Server**: For HTTPS on internal tools (e.g., specific IP or `.local` domains).
   - **User / S/MIME**: For email signing and encryption.
   - **Code Signing**: For signing scripts and executables.

4. **Fill in Details**
   - **Common Name (CN)**: The primary domain name or IP address (e.g., `internal.app` or `192.168.1.50`).
   - **Subject Alternative Names (SANs)**: Additional domains or IPs (optional).
   - **Validity Period**: Choose between 90 days, 1 year, or custom (if allowed).

5. **Submit Request**
   Click **"Submit"**. The system will process your request. 
   - If **Auto-Approval** is enabled for your role, the certificate is issued immediately.
   - If **Manual Approval** is required, the status will be `PENDING` until a Manager approves it.
