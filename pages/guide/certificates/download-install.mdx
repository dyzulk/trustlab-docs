# Download & Formats (PEM, PFX, JKS)

Once your certificate is issued, you can download it in various formats suitable for different servers and applications.

## Available Formats

| Format | Extension | Used For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PEM (Nginx/Apache)** | `.crt`, `.key` | Standard Linux web servers. You get separate Certificate and Private Key files. |
| **PFX / PKCS#12** | `.pfx`, `.p12` | IIS (Windows), Microsoft Exchange, Client Certificates (S/MIME). Contains both key and cert. |
| **JKS (Java)** | `.jks` | Java applications (Tomcat, Spring Boot). |

## How to Download

1. Go to **"My Certificates"** in the dashboard.
2. Click on the certificate ID or the **"View"** button.
3. Scroll to the **"Downloads"** section.
4. Select the format you need and click **Download**.

> [!WARNING]
> The **Private Key** is generated securely. If you lose it, you cannot recover it. You must revoke and re-issue the certificate.
