# Download & Formats (PEM, PFX, JKS)

Once your certificate is issued, you can download it in various formats suitable for different servers and applications.

## Available Formats

| Format | Extension | Used For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PEM (Nginx/Apache)** | `.crt`, `.key` | Standard Linux web servers. You get separate Certificate and Private Key files. |
| **PFX / PKCS#12** | `.pfx`, `.p12` | IIS (Windows), Microsoft Exchange, Client Certificates (S/MIME). Contains both key and cert. |
| **JKS (Java)** | `.jks` | Java applications (Tomcat, Spring Boot). |

## How to Download (Copy & Save)

The dashboard allows you to copy the raw certificate data directly.

1.  Navigate to **"My Certificates"** and click the **View (Eye Icon)** button on your certificate.
2.  **Certificate:** Scroll to the "Certificate (CRT)" section and click the **Copy Icon** in the top right. Paste this into a file named `domain.crt` or `domain.pem`.
3.  **Private Key:** Scroll to the "Private Key (KEY)" section, click **Show**, then click the **Copy Icon**. Paste this into a file named `domain.key`.

> [!TIP]
> Use a plain text editor (Notepad, VS Code, Nano) to save these files. Do not use Word or Rich Text editors.

> [!WARNING]
> The **Private Key** is generated securely. If you lose it, you cannot recover it. You must revoke and re-issue the certificate.

## Installation Examples

### Nginx (PEM)
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name internal.app;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/ssl/internal.app.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/internal.app.key;
}
```

### Windows (PFX)
1. Double-click the downloaded `.pfx` file.
2. Follow the "Certificate Import Wizard".
3. When prompted for a password, enter the password you set during download (or the default export password provided in the UI).
