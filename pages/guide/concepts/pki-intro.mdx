# What is PKI?

**Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** is a set of roles, policies, hardware, software, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, store, and revoke digital certificates.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Asymmetric Encryption
PKI relies on a pair of keys:
- **Public Key**: Shared with everyone. Used to encrypt data.
- **Private Key**: Kept secret. Used to decrypt data and *sign* digital assets.

### 2. The Chain of Trust
A certificate is only trusted if it is signed by a trusted issuer.
- **Root CA**: The anchor of trust. It signs itself (Self-Signed). You explicitly trust this on your device.
- **Intermediate CA**: Signed by Root CA. Used to sign End-Entity certificates for security.
- **End-Entity (Leaf)**: The certificate used on your Web Server or Email.

TrustLab manages this entire chain for your internal organization.

### 3. Why Internal PKI?
Using Public CAs (like Let's Encrypt) is great for public websites, but incompatible with:
- **Intranet IPs** (e.g., `10.0.0.1`).
- **Internal Domains** (e.g., `.local`, `.corp`).
- **VPN Services**.

TrustLab fills this gap by acting as your private authority.
