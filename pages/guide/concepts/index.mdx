# PKI Fundamentals & Trust Context

Understanding the difference between **Private PKI** (TrustLab) and **Public PKI** (Let's Encrypt, DigiCert) is critical for using SSL/TLS effectively and safely.

## The Two Lanes of Trust

The internet security model is built on two distinct "lanes" of trust. Mixing them up causes errors, but using them correctly provides **Military-Grade Security**.

</Cards>

### 1. Public PKI
*   **Issuer**: Let's Encrypt, DigiCert, Google Trust Services.
*   **Trust Model**: Pre-installed in every browser/OS (Chrome, Windows, iOS) by default.
*   **Verification**: Requires you to own a public domain (e.g., `google.com`).
*   **Limitation**: **Cannot** issue certificates for:
    *   Private IP Addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.50`).
    *   Internal Domain Names (e.g., `company.local`, `dev.internal`).
    *   Intranet servers behind a firewall.

### 2. Private PKI (TrustLab)
*   **Issuer**: TrustLab Root CA (Your Organization).
*   **Trust Model**: Trusted **ONLY** by devices that have installed your Root CA.
*   **Strength**: Uses the **exact same math** (RSA-2048/4096, SHA-256) as Public CAs.
*   **Superpower**: Can secure **ANYTHING**:
    *   Localhost (`localhost`).
    *   Database Servers (`10.0.0.5`).
    *   Development Environments.
    *   Internal APIs.

## Why "Military Grade"?

TrustLab utilizes **OpenSSL**, the same cryptographic core used by majority of the world's secure servers, banks, and military networks.

| Feature | TrustLab (Private) | Public CA (Paid) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Encryption** | RSA-2048 / RSA-4096 | RSA-2048 / RSA-4096 |
| **Signature** | SHA-256 | SHA-256 |
| **Protocol** | TLS 1.2 / 1.3 | TLS 1.2 / 1.3 |
| **Global Trust** | ❌ (Manual Install Required) | ✅ (Pre-installed) |
| **Internal IPs** | ✅ Supported | ❌ Forbidden |
| **Cost** | **Free** | $400+/month (for Private CA) |

## Appropriate Use Cases

<Callout type="info" emoji={<BadgeCheck className="w-5 h-5" />}>
  **The Golden Rule:**
  Use **TrustLab** for anything the Public Internet CANNOT access.
  Use **Public CAs** for anything the Public Internet MUST access.
</Callout>

### ✅ Perfect For (Green Lane)
*   **Internal Tools**: Admin Panels, HR Portals, Dashboards.
*   **Development**: Testing HTTPS on `localhost` or `dev.local`.
*   **Databases**: Securing connection to MySQL/Postgres/Mongo.
*   **IoT Devices**: Securing communication between sensors and local hubs.
*   **S/MIME**: Encrypting email between employees.

### ❌ Do Not Use For (Red Lane)
*   **Public E-Commerce**: Your customer's browser will show a "Not Secure" warning.
*   **Public Blogs/Websites**: Random visitors will not have your Root CA installed.

## The "Trust Split" Myth

There is **no conflict** between having TrustLab installed and visiting public websites.
*   When you visit `google.com`, your browser uses the **Public Lane**.
*   When you visit `intranet.corp`, your browser sees the TrustLab signature and uses the **Private Lane**.

They coexist peacefully, providing comprehensive security for your entire digital life.
